Data Science student with a strong passion for problem-solving through data analysis. I specialize in database management and optimization using Python, SQL, and R.

I am constantly updating my knowledge. Recently, I have been studying Data Science at Tripleten - LATAM and have completed bootcamps in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with BEDU - Santander. Furthermore, I have applied my skills in Machine Learning projects such as tariff plan classification and Age Regression with Computer Vision (Transfer Learning).

I am actively seeking an opportunity as an intern or trainee to apply my knowledge in real-world settings and contribute to the development of data-driven solutions.
